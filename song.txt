n the silence of the night, I hear your voice so clear,
Whispers of memories, drawing me near.

Lost in the shadows, chasing dreams untold,
In this maze of emotions, I find my soul.

Memories dance around, in the moon's soft glow,
As the melodies of life, gently ebb and flow.

With each note we weave, a tapestry of dreams,
In the song of life, nothing's as it seems.
